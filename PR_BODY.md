# PR: Sync root copies with src

**What**: Syncs root copies of `App.tsx`, `services/geminiService.ts`, and `lib/supabaseClient.ts` to match `src/` equivalents, and adds `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with agent guidance.

**Why**: Keep duplicate root and `src/` trees consistent for clarity and Vite-based development.
